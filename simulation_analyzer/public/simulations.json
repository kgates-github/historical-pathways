If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Presidential Elections.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n   \n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Corridor to Civil War: The Election of 1860\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Corridor to Civil War: The Election of 1860\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Corridor to Civil War: The Election of 1860\" but is related to \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Corridor to Civil War: The Election of 1860\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want.

The splintering of the Democratic Party into Northern and Southern factions, alongside the emergence of the Constitutional Union Party, reflected the fracturing political landscape. The Republican Party, with its anti-slavery expansion platform, gained momentum, culminating in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln's victory, without a single Southern electoral vote, signaled a shift in national power and was perceived as a threat to slavery. Lincoln's election prompted a cascade of Southern states to secede, starting with South Carolina, as they feared federal interference with slavery. Seceding states formed the Confederate States of America, establishing a parallel government and escalating the national crisis. The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter after Lincoln's inauguration served as the immediate trigger for the Civil War.\n\nThe Election of 1860 was a watershed that led to the secession of Southern states and the onset of the Civil War, embodying the era's stark divisions over slavery and the federal government's role.",

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Journalism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important.

After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Partisan Press Era\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Journalism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Journalism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Partisan Press Era\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Partisan Press Era\" but is related to \"\\Journalism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Journalism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Partisan Press Era\".

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Journalism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Federalist Papers\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Journalism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Journalism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Federalist Papers\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Federalist Papers\" but is related to \"\\Journalism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Journalism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Federalist Papers\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\The Federalist Papers\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Telegraph and News Reporting\".

        "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"The Seneca Falls Convention\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"The first women's rights convention in the United States and its coverage in the press.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Journalism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Seneca Falls Convention\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Journalism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Journalism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Seneca Falls Convention\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Seneca Falls Convention\" but is related to \"\\Journalism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Journalism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Seneca Falls Convention\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\The Seneca Falls Convention\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

Newspapers like the Gazette of the United States and National Gazette represented opposing political ideologies, influencing the opinions of the American electorate. The 1800 presidential election saw the Partisan Press play a crucial role in campaigning, swaying public opinion with fervent editorializing. The spread of the Partisan Press mirrored America's westward expansion, with local newspapers emerging to represent regional political interests. Editors became influential political figures, often wielding significant power in shaping public discourse and party politics. The emergence of the Penny Press in the 1830s marked the decline of the Partisan Press, though its impact on political journalism persisted.\n\nThe Partisan Press Era was a formative time for American media, setting precedents for the interplay between the press and politics. Its influence is evident in today's media landscape, despite the evolution of journalistic standards and practices.",

The Federalist Papers were written to defend the document and persuade New Yorkers to support ratification. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote the essays under the pseudonym 'Publius' to honor the Roman consul Publius Valerius Publicola. The essays were first published in New York newspapers and then in a two-volume compilation. Their arguments reached a broad audience, swaying public opinion. The Federalist Papers addressed key themes such as federalism, checks and balances, and the dangers of factionalism, laying the foundation for American governance. While the papers' direct impact is debated, they influenced the ratification debates, particularly in key states like New York, which ratified the Constitution in July 1788. The Federalist Papers remain a primary source for interpreting the Constitution and understanding the original intent of its framers, influencing both legal and political discourse.\n\nThe Federalist Papers were instrumental in the ratification of the US Constitution and continue to be a vital reference for constitutional interpretation, reflecting early American ideals of governance and political philosophy.",

It marked the beginning of a new era in journalism with an innovative business model focused on advertising revenue and wide circulation. Steam-powered printing presses significantly reduced the time and cost of printing newspapers, allowing publishers to produce mass quantities of papers quickly and sell them for just a penny. Penny papers shifted the focus from subscriber-based revenue to advertising. This change allowed them to lower the price of the newspaper, thereby expanding their audience to include the working class. The content of penny papers was designed to appeal to a broad audience, featuring human-interest stories, crime reports, and serialized novels, which differed from the political and business news of traditional papers. The Penny Press made news accessible to a much wider segment of the population, fostering a more informed public and promoting non-partisan reporting due to their reliance on a broad readership.\n\nThe Penny Press marked a significant shift in journalism, broadening access to information and shaping the future of media by laying the foundation for non-partisan reporting and mass consumption of news.",

Motivated by this exclusion, activists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott spearheaded the organization of a women's rights convention. The convention opened in the Wesleyan Chapel of Seneca Falls, New York. Hundreds of women and some men, including Frederick Douglass, attended. Stanton read the 'Declaration of Sentiments,' which echoed the Declaration of Independence, asserting women's equality with men. The attendees debated 12 resolutions pertaining to women's rights. The most contentious was the ninth resolution, which called for women's suffrage. Eventually, all resolutions were adopted, although the suffrage resolution passed narrowly. The second day was open to the public, including men. The discussions continued and the final resolutions were passed. Frederick Douglass made a powerful case for women's right to vote, which helped sway the audience. The convention's proceedings were soon published and distributed. Reactions were mixed, with some supportive while others ridiculed the event. The convention propelled the issue of women's rights into the national conversation. Press coverage was instrumental in spreading the word about the convention. Newspapers varied from supportive to hostile. The New York Herald, for example, published a scathing critique, while The North Star, edited by Douglass, praised the convention's efforts.\n\nThe Seneca Falls Convention was a foundational moment in the women's suffrage movement. It brought the issue into public discourse and set a precedent for future activism, with press coverage playing a key role in its immediate and lasting impact.",

        "content": "Lecture summary: The Telegraph and News Reporting\n\nExploration of the telegraph's role in revolutionizing news reporting in the 19th century.\n\nThe telegraph, patented by Samuel Morse in 1837, was first used to send a message from Washington D.C. to Baltimore in 1844. This breakthrough demonstrated the potential for instantaneous communication over long distances. The telegraph's adoption by newspapers started slowly but gained momentum as the network expanded. By the mid-1850s, major cities were interconnected, allowing for the swift spread of news. The telegraph changed journalism by necessitating brevity and clarity. Reporters had to learn to write succinctly due to per-word costs, leading to the inverted pyramid style of writing. Founded in 1846, The Associated Press harnessed the power of the telegraph to share news among newspapers, significantly increasing the speed and range of news dissemination. The American Civil War saw the telegraph used extensively for war reporting. Journalists dispatched news of battles quickly, profoundly affecting public perception and morale. The successful laying of the Transatlantic Telegraph Cable in 1866 connected continents, making international news reporting feasible and fostering a new sense of global interconnectedness.\n\nThe telegraph's influence on news reporting was profound, shaping the journalism industry into a modern form. It accelerated the spread of information, redefined news writing, and fostered a new global consciousness.",
