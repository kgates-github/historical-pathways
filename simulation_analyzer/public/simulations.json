If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n   \n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Women's Education and Literacy in the 19th Century\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Women's Education and Literacy in the 19th Century\" that is not directly related to \"\\Women's Education and Literacy in the 19th Century\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Women's Education and Literacy in the 19th Century\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!!

The expert answer, while much more detailed and expansive, covering a broader timeline and including specific statistics, ideologies, and historical figures, does not contradict the information presented in the submitted answer. The differences between the two answers are in the depth and breadth of information provided rather than in factual content.

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Women's Suffrage Movement in the 1850s\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Women's Suffrage Movement in the 1850s\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Women's Suffrage Movement in the 1850s\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Women's Suffrage Movement in the 1850s\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!!

For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important.

After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Fifteenth Amendment and Women's Suffrage\".

These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Fifteenth Amendment and Women's Suffrage\".

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Nineteenth Amendment\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Nineteenth Amendment\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Nineteenth Amendment\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Nineteenth Amendment\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!!

Few had access to formal schooling, reflecting societal views on gender roles. The establishment of female seminaries marked the beginning of formal education for women, offering a curriculum that included arts, sciences, and moral philosophy. The Common School Movement, spearheaded by Horace Mann, advocated for universal public education, which gradually included girls, thus increasing female literacy. In the mid-19th century, women began to gain access to higher education with the founding of female colleges, marking a significant step towards gender equality in education. The Civil War disrupted but also propelled educational reforms. Post-war, there was a surge in educational opportunities for women, partly due to the need for educated teachers. By the late 19th century, women's literacy rates had significantly increased, and women's rights activists were using their education to fight for suffrage and other reforms.\n\nThe 19th century witnessed a remarkable transition in women's education in America, culminating in a substantial rise in literacy rates and the empowerment of women through learning.",

This event sowed the seeds for their future activism. Stanton, Mott, and other activists planned the convention in a matter of days. They advertised it primarily through the local press and word of mouth, emphasizing the importance of discussing women's rights. On the first day, only women were invited to attend. They discussed the role of women in society and began drafting a Declaration of Sentiments, modeled after the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Sentiments outlined grievances and set the agenda for women's rights. It asserted that women were equal to men and entitled to the same inalienable rights. The convention and its Declaration sparked immediate controversy. While some supported the cause, others ridiculed the participants and their demands for equality. The Seneca Falls Convention ignited the women's suffrage movement in the U.S. and inspired subsequent conventions and activism leading to the eventual passage of the 19th Amendment.\n\nThe Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 was an early and significant gathering advocating for women's rights, ultimately laying the groundwork for future reforms and the women's suffrage movement.",

In 1850, the first National Women's Rights Convention took place in Worcester, Massachusetts, expanding the movement's reach and uniting activists. Sojourner Truth delivered her 'Ain't I a Woman?' speech in 1851, highlighting the intersection of gender and race in the fight for equality. Paulina Wright Davis launched 'Una,' a periodical dedicated to women's rights, signifying the growing importance of print media in the movement. American activists began collaborating with their British counterparts, sharing strategies and bolstering the international suffrage effort. Ideological differences led to a split within the suffrage movement, with some focusing on broader social reforms and others on suffrage alone.\n\nThe 1850s were a formative period for the women's suffrage movement in the U.S., characterized by advocacy, the rise of national conventions, and the growing use of the press. This decade laid the groundwork for the eventual success of the movement, despite internal divisions.",

Key figures like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony advocated for both causes, leading to a shared struggle for universal suffrage. The Fifteenth Amendment was passed by Congress and subsequently ratified by the states, granting African American men the right to vote. It notably excluded women, leading to significant debates within the suffrage movement. The exclusion of women from the Fifteenth Amendment led to a split within the suffrage movement. Some activists supported the Amendment despite its limitations, while others, feeling betrayed, opposed it for not going far enough. The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) emerged from the merger of two competing suffrage organizations, focusing on a state-by-state campaign for women's voting rights. A new generation of suffragists, like Alice Paul, adopted more militant tactics, including protests and hunger strikes. This shift in strategy played a crucial role in revitalizing the movement and pushing for the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment's exclusion of women from the right to vote had a profound impact on the suffrage movement, leading to internal divisions but eventually contributing to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women suffrage.",

This early gathering for women's rights, spearheaded by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, marked the start of a concerted campaign for equal voting rights. The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was formed in 1890, uniting two major suffragist groups under the leadership of Susan B. Anthony. NAWSA played a central role in advocating for women's voting rights. In the early 20th century, suffragists intensified their efforts. They employed a variety of tactics including parades, silent vigils, and civil disobedience to garner public support for the suffrage cause. The National Woman's Party, led by Alice Paul, organized the Silent Sentinels, who picketed the White House. Their peaceful protest and subsequent arrests brought national attention to the suffrage movement. After decades of advocacy, Congress finally passed the Nineteenth Amendment on June 4, 1919. This victory was a significant milestone, requiring ratification by three-quarters of the states. The ratification process was fraught with challenges as suffragists lobbied state legislatures. Tennessee's approval on August 18, 1920, provided the necessary majority to ratify the amendment.\n\nThe Nineteenth Amendment's ratification marked a significant expansion of democratic principles in the United States. It also set the stage for further civil rights advancements and the continued fight for equality in the electoral process.",

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Women's Education\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Women's Education\" that is not directly related to \"\\Women's Education\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Women's Education\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\Women's Education\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

        "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"Lyceum Movement\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"A movement focused on adult education through public lectures, contributing to the spread of knowledge and literacy.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Lyceum Movement\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Lyceum Movement\" that is not directly related to \"\\Lyceum Movement\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Lyceum Movement\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\Lyceum Movement\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Women's Rights Conventions\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Women's Rights Conventions\" that is not directly related to \"\\Women's Rights Conventions\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Women's Rights Conventions\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\Women's Rights Conventions\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

These laws were designed to maintain the power structure of slavery by preventing access to education. Despite legal restrictions, enslaved African Americans pursued literacy through clandestine means, often taught by fellow slaves, free blacks, or sympathetic whites. Abolitionists, recognizing the power of literacy, supported educational initiatives for slaves and free blacks, contributing to a growing movement towards emancipation. The Civil War disrupted the Southern social order, creating opportunities for slaves and freedmen to pursue education more openly, often with the aid of Northern missionary societies. Post-war Reconstruction saw significant efforts to establish schools for African Americans, with varying degrees of success and opposition from Southern whites. The Freedmen's Bureau played a crucial role in promoting African American education during Reconstruction, though it faced substantial resistance and was eventually dismantled. The legacy of literacy among African Americans laid the foundation for future civil rights movements and the ongoing struggle for equality and empowerment.\n\nLiteracy among enslaved and freed African Americans was a profound form of resistance and a stepping stone towards achieving civil rights. It remains a testament to the resilience and determination of those who fought for education against immense odds.",

Mann advocated for schools that served all children regardless of background, promoting a standard curriculum and professional teacher training. The movement gained momentum as Mann lobbied for state funding through taxes to ensure schools' accessibility to all socio-economic classes. Despite facing opposition from religious groups and private educators, Mann persisted in promoting his vision of public education. The movement spread beyond Massachusetts, influencing education reform across various states and laying the groundwork for the modern public school system.\n\nThe Common School Movement, spearheaded by Horace Mann, was instrumental in the establishment of a public education system that aimed to be universal, free, and accessible to all American children, significantly increasing literacy rates and shaping the future of American society.",

Advocates like Emma Willard began to call for structured schooling for girls, emphasizing the importance of educated mothers in a republic. The establishment of female academies, such as Troy Female Seminary, provided unprecedented academic opportunities for women, marking a departure from limited domestic education. Curricula at female academies expanded, including subjects like mathematics and science, reflecting a growing belief in women's intellectual capabilities. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, founded by Mary Lyon, became one of the first institutions offering higher education to women, a precursor to women's colleges. The Common School Movement, spearheaded by Horace Mann, advocated for universal public education, which indirectly supported the cause of women's education by promoting literacy for all.\n\nThe evolution of women's education from the early 19th century to the mid-19th century marked a significant shift in societal attitudes towards female intellectual capacity and their role in public life.",

His idea was to educate citizens in sciences and the arts through local lyceums. The movement quickly spread across New England and the Midwest, with hundreds of lyceums established, offering lectures on a variety of subjects to a growing middle-class audience. Lectures covered topics from science to literature, often delivered by prominent figures. Formats varied, including debates and town hall meetings, enriching community engagement. The lyceums played a key role in adult education and the promotion of literacy, also becoming platforms for social reform and intellectual exchange in pre-Civil War America. Despite declining in popularity due to alternative forms of entertainment and education, the Lyceum Movement left a lasting impact on American cultural and educational practices.\n\nThe Lyceum Movement was instrumental in advancing adult education and literacy in the United States, setting a precedent for public lectures and community learning that continues to influence educational initiatives today.",

Organized by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, it produced the Declaration of Sentiments, which called for equal rights including the right to vote. Following Seneca Falls, the Rochester Women's Rights Convention took place, where many attendees of the former reconvened. It was the second such convention and furthered the momentum of the movement. The National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts, expanded the scope of the movement. It became an annual event, drawing larger crowds and increasing the visibility of women's suffrage and educational rights. The outbreak of the Civil War put a temporary halt to the conventions. The focus of activists shifted towards the war effort and the abolition of slavery. After the war, the women's rights movement regained momentum. The American Equal Rights Association was formed, and the push for suffrage and educational reforms continued with renewed vigor. In 1869, the movement split into two factions over disagreements on the Fifteenth Amendment and strategies for achieving suffrage. This led to the formation of the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association. The two factions reconciled and merged into the National American Woman Suffrage Association in 1890, marking the end of the early convention era and setting the stage for the final push toward the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Women's Rights Conventions were instrumental in promoting the cause of gender equality, particularly in the realm of education and literacy. Their legacy paved the way for future advancements and the eventual achievement of women's suffrage.",

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Populism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n   \n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Origins of American Populism\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Origins of American Populism\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Origins of American Populism\" but is related to \"\\Populism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Origins of American Populism\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want.

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Populism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important.

After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Populist Party Platform: Omaha Convention 1892\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Populist Party Platform: Omaha Convention 1892\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Populist Party Platform: Omaha Convention 1892\" but is related to \"\\Populism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event.

        "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"The Election of 1896: Populism at the Crossroads\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"Examining the pivotal 1896 election, the Populist's endorsement of William Jennings Bryan, and its implications for the movement.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Populism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n   \n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Election of 1896: Populism at the Crossroads\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Election of 1896: Populism at the Crossroads\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Election of 1896: Populism at the Crossroads\" but is related to \"\\Populism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Election of 1896: Populism at the Crossroads\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\The Election of 1896: Populism at the Crossroads\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

        "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"The Election of 1892\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"The election where the Populist Party tested its political influence nationally.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Populism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Election of 1892\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Election of 1892\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Election of 1892\" but is related to \"\\Populism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Election of 1892\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\The Election of 1892\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Populism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Election of 1896\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Election of 1896\" that is not directly related to \"\\Election of 1896\" but is related to \"\\Populism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Election of 1896\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\Election of 1896\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

Farmers faced falling prices for crops, rising costs of supplies, and unfair railroad practices, leading to widespread economic distress. The Patrons of Husbandry, or the Grange, was an organization that advocated for social and economic reforms to assist farmers, setting the stage for later populist ideas. Exploitative railroad practices and monopolies exacerbated the plight of farmers, who were often charged exorbitant rates to transport crops, deepening their economic woes. In response to their struggles, farmers formed alliances to collectively bargain and push for political changes. These alliances were precursors to the People's Party. The 1890 Ocala Demands outlined the political objectives of the Farmers' Alliances, including monetary reform, railroad regulation, and the direct election of senators. The economic struggle and political activism led to the establishment of the People's Party in 1891, which aimed to unite the agrarian movement under a common banner. At the 1892 convention in Omaha, the People's Party adopted a platform that encapsulated populist ideals and called for significant economic and political reforms.\n\nThe rise of American Populism was a response to the economic plight of the agrarian class, culminating in the establishment of the People's Party. This movement laid the groundwork for future political discourse and reform.",

The Panic of 1893 exacerbated debates on monetary policy, with Populists pushing for silver coinage to inflate the currency and aid debtors. Bryan's 'Cross of Gold' speech at the Democratic Convention captivated the Populist Party, leading to his endorsement over their own candidate. Bryan embarked on a rigorous campaign, while McKinley's front porch campaign emphasized stability and prosperity through the gold standard. McKinley's victory solidified the gold standard and marked a setback for Populism, which struggled to maintain influence in subsequent years.\n\nThe 1896 election underscored the nation's deep economic divisions and led to the decline of the Populist Party, but left a legacy of reform that would influence future American politics.",

At the convention, the Populist Party adopted the Omaha Platform, which called for widespread reforms, including the direct election of senators, a graduated income tax, and the expansion of the money supply. The platform advocated for the free coinage of silver, government ownership of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones, and the establishment of a sub-treasury system to aid farmers. The platform proposed political reforms such as the secret ballot, the initiative and referendum, and the direct election of U.S. Senators to empower the common people. The Populists also addressed social concerns by demanding shorter workdays, immigration restrictions, and the prohibition of Pinkerton detectives in labor disputes. The Omaha Platform resonated with many working-class Americans but alarmed the political establishment and business leaders, who viewed it as radical and a threat to the status quo.\n\nThe Omaha Convention and Populist Party Platform of 1892 represented a comprehensive challenge to the prevailing economic and political order, setting the stage for future progressive reforms.",

The Populist Party, officially known as the People's Party, was formed to address the grievances of farmers and laborers, seeking to challenge the two-party system. The Populists nominated James B. Weaver, the Democrats re-nominated Grover Cleveland, and the Republicans nominated incumbent President Benjamin Harrison. The campaign focused on the nation's economic issues, with Populists advocating for the free coinage of silver, a graduated income tax, and government control of railroads. On Election Day, the Populist Party made a strong showing, though Grover Cleveland ultimately won, signaling a shift in the political landscape. The Populist Party's influence continued to grow, affecting subsequent political discourse and laying the groundwork for future reform movements.\n\nThe Election of 1892 was a testament to the Populist Party's ability to mobilize and influence national politics, foreshadowing progressive reforms in the early 20th century.",

In 1891, the Populist or People's Party was established, promoting a platform that included the free coinage of silver, government control of railroads, and a graduated income tax. The severe economic depression, known as the Panic of 1893, heightened the political tension and set the stage for the 1896 election as a referendum on Populism. William Jennings Bryan, advocating for the free silver movement, was nominated by the Democrats and endorsed by the Populists. Republican William McKinley campaigned on maintaining the gold standard and economic stability. The election took place on November 3, 1896, with McKinley winning a decisive victory over Bryan, signaling the rejection of Populist proposals by the majority of the electorate. McKinley's victory and the subsequent economic recovery led to the waning of the Populist Party, which never again reached the influence it held in the early 1890s.\n\nThe election of 1896 effectively ended Populism's prominence in American politics. It affirmed the country's commitment to the gold standard and ushered in an era of Republican dominance.",

Newspapers like the Gazette of the United States and National Gazette represented opposing political ideologies, influencing the opinions of the American electorate. The 1800 presidential election saw the Partisan Press play a crucial role in campaigning, swaying public opinion with fervent editorializing. The spread of the Partisan Press mirrored America's westward expansion, with local newspapers emerging to represent regional political interests. Editors became influential political figures, often wielding significant power in shaping public discourse and party politics. The emergence of the Penny Press in the 1830s marked the decline of the Partisan Press, though its impact on political journalism persisted.\n\nThe Partisan Press Era was a formative time for American media, setting precedents for the interplay between the press and politics. Its influence is evident in today's media landscape, despite the evolution of journalistic standards and practices.",

The Federalist Papers were written to defend the document and persuade New Yorkers to support ratification. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote the essays under the pseudonym 'Publius' to honor the Roman consul Publius Valerius Publicola. The essays were first published in New York newspapers and then in a two-volume compilation. Their arguments reached a broad audience, swaying public opinion. The Federalist Papers addressed key themes such as federalism, checks and balances, and the dangers of factionalism, laying the foundation for American governance. While the papers' direct impact is debated, they influenced the ratification debates, particularly in key states like New York, which ratified the Constitution in July 1788. The Federalist Papers remain a primary source for interpreting the Constitution and understanding the original intent of its framers, influencing both legal and political discourse.\n\nThe Federalist Papers were instrumental in the ratification of the US Constitution and continue to be a vital reference for constitutional interpretation, reflecting early American ideals of governance and political philosophy.",

It marked the beginning of a new era in journalism with an innovative business model focused on advertising revenue and wide circulation. Steam-powered printing presses significantly reduced the time and cost of printing newspapers, allowing publishers to produce mass quantities of papers quickly and sell them for just a penny. Penny papers shifted the focus from subscriber-based revenue to advertising. This change allowed them to lower the price of the newspaper, thereby expanding their audience to include the working class. The content of penny papers was designed to appeal to a broad audience, featuring human-interest stories, crime reports, and serialized novels, which differed from the political and business news of traditional papers. The Penny Press made news accessible to a much wider segment of the population, fostering a more informed public and promoting non-partisan reporting due to their reliance on a broad readership.\n\nThe Penny Press marked a significant shift in journalism, broadening access to information and shaping the future of media by laying the foundation for non-partisan reporting and mass consumption of news.",

Motivated by this exclusion, activists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott spearheaded the organization of a women's rights convention. The convention opened in the Wesleyan Chapel of Seneca Falls, New York. Hundreds of women and some men, including Frederick Douglass, attended. Stanton read the 'Declaration of Sentiments,' which echoed the Declaration of Independence, asserting women's equality with men. The attendees debated 12 resolutions pertaining to women's rights. The most contentious was the ninth resolution, which called for women's suffrage. Eventually, all resolutions were adopted, although the suffrage resolution passed narrowly. The second day was open to the public, including men. The discussions continued and the final resolutions were passed. Frederick Douglass made a powerful case for women's right to vote, which helped sway the audience. The convention's proceedings were soon published and distributed. Reactions were mixed, with some supportive while others ridiculed the event. The convention propelled the issue of women's rights into the national conversation. Press coverage was instrumental in spreading the word about the convention. Newspapers varied from supportive to hostile. The New York Herald, for example, published a scathing critique, while The North Star, edited by Douglass, praised the convention's efforts.\n\nThe Seneca Falls Convention was a foundational moment in the women's suffrage movement. It brought the issue into public discourse and set a precedent for future activism, with press coverage playing a key role in its immediate and lasting impact.",

This breakthrough demonstrated the potential for instantaneous communication over long distances. The telegraph's adoption by newspapers started slowly but gained momentum as the network expanded. By the mid-1850s, major cities were interconnected, allowing for the swift spread of news. The telegraph changed journalism by necessitating brevity and clarity. Reporters had to learn to write succinctly due to per-word costs, leading to the inverted pyramid style of writing. Founded in 1846, The Associated Press harnessed the power of the telegraph to share news among newspapers, significantly increasing the speed and range of news dissemination. The American Civil War saw the telegraph used extensively for war reporting. Journalists dispatched news of battles quickly, profoundly affecting public perception and morale. The successful laying of the Transatlantic Telegraph Cable in 1866 connected continents, making international news reporting feasible and fostering a new sense of global interconnectedness.\n\nThe telegraph's influence on news reporting was profound, shaping the journalism industry into a modern form. It accelerated the spread of information, redefined news writing, and fostered a new global consciousness.",
