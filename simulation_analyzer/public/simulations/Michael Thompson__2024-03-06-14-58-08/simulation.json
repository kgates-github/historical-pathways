If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Populism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n   \n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Origins of American Populism\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Origins of American Populism\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Origins of American Populism\" but is related to \"\\Populism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Origins of American Populism\".

      "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"The Election of 1892\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"The election where the Populist Party tested its political influence nationally.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Populism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Election of 1892\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Election of 1892\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Election of 1892\" but is related to \"\\Populism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Election of 1892\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\The Election of 1892\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

      "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"Election of 1896\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"The election that marked the defeat of Populism as a political force.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Populism.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Election of 1896\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Election of 1896\" that is not directly related to \"\\Election of 1896\" but is related to \"\\Populism\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Populism\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Election of 1896\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\Election of 1896\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

      "content": "Lecture summary: The Origins of American Populism\n\nExploration of the Populist movement's rise, focusing on the socio-economic factors that led to the People's Party formation.\n\nThe roots of Populism can be traced back to the post-Civil War agricultural crisis. Farmers faced falling prices for crops, rising costs of supplies, and unfair railroad practices, leading to widespread economic distress. The Patrons of Husbandry, or the Grange, was an organization that advocated for social and economic reforms to assist farmers, setting the stage for later populist ideas. Exploitative railroad practices and monopolies exacerbated the plight of farmers, who were often charged exorbitant rates to transport crops, deepening their economic woes. In response to their struggles, farmers formed alliances to collectively bargain and push for political changes. These alliances were precursors to the People's Party. The 1890 Ocala Demands outlined the political objectives of the Farmers' Alliances, including monetary reform, railroad regulation, and the direct election of senators. The economic struggle and political activism led to the establishment of the People's Party in 1891, which aimed to unite the agrarian movement under a common banner. At the 1892 convention in Omaha, the People's Party adopted a platform that encapsulated populist ideals and called for significant economic and political reforms.\n\nThe rise of American Populism was a response to the economic plight of the agrarian class, culminating in the establishment of the People's Party. This movement laid the groundwork for future political discourse and reform.",

The Panic of 1893 exacerbated debates on monetary policy, with Populists pushing for silver coinage to inflate the currency and aid debtors. Bryan's 'Cross of Gold' speech at the Democratic Convention captivated the Populist Party, leading to his endorsement over their own candidate. Bryan embarked on a rigorous campaign, while McKinley's front porch campaign emphasized stability and prosperity through the gold standard. McKinley's victory solidified the gold standard and marked a setback for Populism, which struggled to maintain influence in subsequent years.\n\nThe 1896 election underscored the nation's deep economic divisions and led to the decline of the Populist Party, but left a legacy of reform that would influence future American politics.",

At the convention, the Populist Party adopted the Omaha Platform, which called for widespread reforms, including the direct election of senators, a graduated income tax, and the expansion of the money supply. The platform advocated for the free coinage of silver, government ownership of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones, and the establishment of a sub-treasury system to aid farmers. The platform proposed political reforms such as the secret ballot, the initiative and referendum, and the direct election of U.S. Senators to empower the common people. The Populists also addressed social concerns by demanding shorter workdays, immigration restrictions, and the prohibition of Pinkerton detectives in labor disputes. The Omaha Platform resonated with many working-class Americans but alarmed the political establishment and business leaders, who viewed it as radical and a threat to the status quo.\n\nThe Omaha Convention and Populist Party Platform of 1892 represented a comprehensive challenge to the prevailing economic and political order, setting the stage for future progressive reforms.",

In 1891, the Populist or People's Party was established, promoting a platform that included the free coinage of silver, government control of railroads, and a graduated income tax. The severe economic depression, known as the Panic of 1893, heightened the political tension and set the stage for the 1896 election as a referendum on Populism. William Jennings Bryan, advocating for the free silver movement, was nominated by the Democrats and endorsed by the Populists. Republican William McKinley campaigned on maintaining the gold standard and economic stability. The election took place on November 3, 1896, with McKinley winning a decisive victory over Bryan, signaling the rejection of Populist proposals by the majority of the electorate. McKinley's victory and the subsequent economic recovery led to the waning of the Populist Party, which never again reached the influence it held in the early 1890s.\n\nThe election of 1896 effectively ended Populism's prominence in American politics.
