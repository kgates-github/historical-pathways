    "Historical Pathways is a speculative design that imagines how an AI agent might teach users history. \n",
    "The app acts as a coach that takes any historical event as a starting point and guides users through constellations of related events.\n",

    "- Teacher class takes attributes from the student persona and creates a few starting lectures that the student is likely to be interested in.\n",

    "### Student Persona\n",
    "- Student class takes a persona config that ourlines a few attributes:\n",
    "  - Historical eras: These are broad areas of history that have some kind of time and place (e.g., \"Early American Republic\", \"The Meiji Resortation\", \"Election of Abraham Lincoln\")\n",
    "  - Topics of interest: These are topics that can cut across time and place (e.g., \"military history\", \"social justice\", \"technology\")\n",
    "  - Time constraint: Score from 1 - 5 or so. This will determine the numnber of lectures they can consume.\n",
    "- Student class consumes lectures and evaluates them to pick whether to explore a topic.\n",
    "- Tracks overall satisfaction to determine whether to exit simulation.\n",
    "- Students will exit after n lectures or before that if their satisfaction is too low.\n",
