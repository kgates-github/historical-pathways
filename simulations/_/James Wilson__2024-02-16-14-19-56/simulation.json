For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important.

After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\A New Political Landscape: The Election of 1824\".

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Presidential Elections.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Nullification Crisis\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Nullification Crisis\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Nullification Crisis\" but is related to \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Nullification Crisis\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!!

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Presidential Elections.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Election of 1832\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Election of 1832\" that is not directly related to \"\\Election of 1832\" but is related to \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Presidential Elections\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Election of 1832\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\Election of 1832\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

President Monroe's two terms were characterized by nationalistic fervor and the absence of major political strife, setting the stage for the 1824 election. The 1824 election saw multiple candidates from the same party vying for the presidency. Key figures included John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and William H. Crawford, reflecting regional divisions and personal ambitions. No candidate secured a majority of the electoral votes, with Andrew Jackson receiving the most popular and electoral votes, followed by John Quincy Adams. This deadlock required the House of Representatives to decide the outcome. Henry Clay, as Speaker of the House, played a pivotal role in influencing the election's outcome. His support for John Quincy Adams was crucial when the House voted, leading to Adams's victory and charges of a 'Corrupt Bargain'. Allegations of a 'Corrupt Bargain' between Adams and Clay emerged after Clay was appointed Secretary of State. This accusation became a central issue, influencing public opinion and the subsequent political realignment. The election's outcome led to the fracturing of the Democratic-Republican Party and the emergence of new political factions, setting the stage for the creation of the Democratic Party and the Whig Party in the following years.\n\nThe 1824 election was a watershed moment in American political history, leading to the end of the 'Era of Good Feelings' and the beginning of a new era of party politics. The controversy of the 'Corrupt Bargain' and the subsequent shift in political alliances laid the groundwork for the two-party system that would dominate American politics for decades to come.",

This led to the enactment of tariffs that favored Northern manufacturers but were detrimental to Southern agricultural interests. The Tariff of 1828, labeled as 'abominable' by its Southern critics, significantly increased duties on imported goods, especially raw materials essential to the South, exacerbating regional tensions. The South's economy, heavily reliant on agriculture and trade, suffered under the new tariff. Southern leaders, including John C. Calhoun, protested vehemently, claiming the tariff was unconstitutional and discriminatory. The tariff's fallout led to the Nullification Crisis, where South Carolina declared the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 null and void, challenging the federal government's authority and setting the stage for conflict. The tariff controversy influenced presidential elections, with Andrew Jackson's administration facing opposition from states' rights advocates and contributing to the formation of the Whig Party.\n\nThe Tariff of Abominations was more than a fiscal policy; it was a catalyst for sectional discord and a precursor to the Civil War, influencing the political landscape and presidential elections of the era.",

The 1824 presidential election saw Jackson win the popular vote but lose the presidency in the House of Representatives to John Quincy Adams, an event that deeply embittered Jackson and his supporters. The 'corrupt bargain' accusation arose when Henry Clay, eliminated from the presidency, threw his support behind Adams, who subsequently appointed Clay as Secretary of State, fueling Jacksonian outrage. Jackson's followers organized into what became the Democratic Party, representing a coalition of farmers, frontier settlers, and urban workers, opposing the perceived elitism of Adams's policies. The 1828 campaign was marked by fierce mudslinging. Jackson was portrayed as a military tyrant, while Adams was attacked as an out-of-touch elitist. This election was one of the first to see organized mass rallies and populist tactics. Jackson's victory ushered in the 'spoils system,' rewarding political supporters with public office. This practice significantly altered the dynamics of federal employment and political loyalty.\n\nAndrew Jackson's rise to the presidency marked a significant shift towards a more inclusive form of democracy. His victory was not just personal but also a reflection of changing political attitudes and the empowerment of a broader segment of the American populace.",

Southern states, reliant on foreign trade, opposed the tariff as it harmed their economy and favored the industrial North. South Carolina, hit hard by the tariff, argued that states had the right to nullify federal laws deemed unconstitutional. The state's opposition culminated in the Nullification Convention, declaring the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 null and void within its borders. President Andrew Jackson issued a proclamation against South Carolina's nullification, asserting the supremacy of federal law and warning against disunion. Congress passed the Force Bill, authorizing Jackson to use military action to enforce federal tariffs. This bill demonstrated the federal government's commitment to maintaining the union and the supremacy of federal law. Henry Clay proposed the Compromise Tariff of 1833, gradually reducing the tariff rates over the next decade. The compromise defused the immediate crisis but left unresolved tensions over states' rights.\n\nThe Nullification Crisis was a critical chapter in the ongoing debate over federalism and states' rights. It underscored the sectional divisions that would eventually lead to the Civil War and set a precedent for federal authority over states.",

His veto of the bank's recharter bill polarized the electorate, galvanizing his opponents into forming the National Republican Party. The Anti-Masonic Party, historically significant as the first third party in the United States, gained momentum by capitalizing on public fears of secret societies, becoming a force in the election and influencing future third-party politics. Henry Clay, the National Republican candidate, opposed Jackson by advocating for a strong national bank and tariffs, representing the interests of the commercial and industrial North against Jackson's agrarian base. The 1832 election introduced novel campaign techniques, such as national conventions and party platforms, which would become staples in American politics, shaping the way candidates campaigned and engaged with voters. Andrew Jackson won the election decisively, securing his second term. His victory reinforced the Democratic Party's dominance and the viability of his policies, particularly his stance on the national bank and states' rights.\n\nThe Election of 1832 was a formative event in the development of American political parties and electoral politics.
