The outcome of this election served as the immediate catalyst for the secession of Southern states, which ultimately plunged the nation into the Civil War.",

For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important.

After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Corridor to Civil War: The Election of 1860\".

These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event.

      "content": "Lecture summary: The Corridor to Civil War: The Election of 1860\n\nAn examination of how Abraham Lincoln's election led to Southern secession and the American Civil War.\n\nThe United States in the 1850s was marked by rising tensions over slavery, as the nation expanded westward. The Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act further inflamed the debates, setting the stage for a contentious election. In the lead-up to the 1860 election, the Democratic Party split into Northern and Southern factions. The emergence of the Constitutional Union Party further divided the vote, with each region rallying around its own interests. Abraham Lincoln's nomination by the Republican Party brought to the forefront a platform focused on halting the spread of slavery. His views were perceived as a direct threat to the Southern way of life. Lincoln won the presidency without a single electoral vote from the Southern states, revealing an electorate split along sectional lines. His victory was seen in the South as a loss of political influence and control over their own institutions. Following Lincoln's election, South Carolina and several other Southern states seceded from the Union. These actions were driven by fears that Lincoln's administration would abolish slavery. The seceded states formed the Confederate States of America, drafting their own constitution. This defiant move solidified the split between North and South, as the Confederacy sought to establish itself as a separate nation. Tensions escalated as both sides prepared for conflict. The Union's refusal to recognize the Confederacy and the standoff at Fort Sumter were the final steps on the path to war.\n\nThe election of 1860 was a critical juncture in American history, leading directly to the secession of Southern states and setting the nation on a course to Civil War. The election highlighted the deep divisions within the country and the failure of political compromise to resolve the issue of slavery.",
