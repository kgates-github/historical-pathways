      "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"The Common School Movement\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"Exploring Horace Mann's advocacy for public education, shaping the foundation of American schooling and literacy.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n   \n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Common School Movement\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Common School Movement\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Common School Movement\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Common School Movement\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\The Common School Movement\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

      "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"The Literacy of Slaves and Freedmen\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"Analyzing the impact of literacy among enslaved and freed African Americans before and after the Civil War.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n   \n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Literacy of Slaves and Freedmen\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Literacy of Slaves and Freedmen\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Literacy of Slaves and Freedmen\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Literacy of Slaves and Freedmen\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\The Literacy of Slaves and Freedmen\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

      "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"Women's Education\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"The movement for women's education and the establishment of female academies paralleled the Common School Movement.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Women's Education\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Women's Education\" that is not directly related to \"\\Women's Education\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Women's Education\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\Women's Education\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

      "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"Lyceum Movement\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"A movement focused on adult education through public lectures, contributing to the spread of knowledge and literacy.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Lyceum Movement\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Lyceum Movement\" that is not directly related to \"\\Lyceum Movement\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Lyceum Movement\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\Lyceum Movement\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Women's Rights Conventions\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Women's Rights Conventions\" that is not directly related to \"\\Women's Rights Conventions\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Women's Rights Conventions\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\Women's Rights Conventions\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

These laws were designed to maintain the power structure of slavery by preventing access to education. Despite legal restrictions, enslaved African Americans pursued literacy through clandestine means, often taught by fellow slaves, free blacks, or sympathetic whites. Abolitionists, recognizing the power of literacy, supported educational initiatives for slaves and free blacks, contributing to a growing movement towards emancipation. The Civil War disrupted the Southern social order, creating opportunities for slaves and freedmen to pursue education more openly, often with the aid of Northern missionary societies. Post-war Reconstruction saw significant efforts to establish schools for African Americans, with varying degrees of success and opposition from Southern whites. The Freedmen's Bureau played a crucial role in promoting African American education during Reconstruction, though it faced substantial resistance and was eventually dismantled. The legacy of literacy among African Americans laid the foundation for future civil rights movements and the ongoing struggle for equality and empowerment.\n\nLiteracy among enslaved and freed African Americans was a profound form of resistance and a stepping stone towards achieving civil rights. It remains a testament to the resilience and determination of those who fought for education against immense odds.",

Mann advocated for schools that served all children regardless of background, promoting a standard curriculum and professional teacher training. The movement gained momentum as Mann lobbied for state funding through taxes to ensure schools' accessibility to all socio-economic classes. Despite facing opposition from religious groups and private educators, Mann persisted in promoting his vision of public education. The movement spread beyond Massachusetts, influencing education reform across various states and laying the groundwork for the modern public school system.\n\nThe Common School Movement, spearheaded by Horace Mann, was instrumental in the establishment of a public education system that aimed to be universal, free, and accessible to all American children, significantly increasing literacy rates and shaping the future of American society.",

Advocates like Emma Willard began to call for structured schooling for girls, emphasizing the importance of educated mothers in a republic. The establishment of female academies, such as Troy Female Seminary, provided unprecedented academic opportunities for women, marking a departure from limited domestic education. Curricula at female academies expanded, including subjects like mathematics and science, reflecting a growing belief in women's intellectual capabilities. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, founded by Mary Lyon, became one of the first institutions offering higher education to women, a precursor to women's colleges. The Common School Movement, spearheaded by Horace Mann, advocated for universal public education, which indirectly supported the cause of women's education by promoting literacy for all.\n\nThe evolution of women's education from the early 19th century to the mid-19th century marked a significant shift in societal attitudes towards female intellectual capacity and their role in public life.",

His idea was to educate citizens in sciences and the arts through local lyceums. The movement quickly spread across New England and the Midwest, with hundreds of lyceums established, offering lectures on a variety of subjects to a growing middle-class audience. Lectures covered topics from science to literature, often delivered by prominent figures. Formats varied, including debates and town hall meetings, enriching community engagement. The lyceums played a key role in adult education and the promotion of literacy, also becoming platforms for social reform and intellectual exchange in pre-Civil War America. Despite declining in popularity due to alternative forms of entertainment and education, the Lyceum Movement left a lasting impact on American cultural and educational practices.\n\nThe Lyceum Movement was instrumental in advancing adult education and literacy in the United States, setting a precedent for public lectures and community learning that continues to influence educational initiatives today.",

Organized by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, it produced the Declaration of Sentiments, which called for equal rights including the right to vote. Following Seneca Falls, the Rochester Women's Rights Convention took place, where many attendees of the former reconvened. It was the second such convention and furthered the momentum of the movement. The National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts, expanded the scope of the movement. It became an annual event, drawing larger crowds and increasing the visibility of women's suffrage and educational rights. The outbreak of the Civil War put a temporary halt to the conventions. The focus of activists shifted towards the war effort and the abolition of slavery. After the war, the women's rights movement regained momentum. The American Equal Rights Association was formed, and the push for suffrage and educational reforms continued with renewed vigor. In 1869, the movement split into two factions over disagreements on the Fifteenth Amendment and strategies for achieving suffrage. This led to the formation of the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association. The two factions reconciled and merged into the National American Woman Suffrage Association in 1890, marking the end of the early convention era and setting the stage for the final push toward the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Women's Rights Conventions were instrumental in promoting the cause of gender equality, particularly in the realm of education and literacy. Their legacy paved the way for future advancements and the eventual achievement of women's suffrage.",
