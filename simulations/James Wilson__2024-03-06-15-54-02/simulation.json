If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n   \n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\Women's Education and Literacy in the 19th Century\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\Women's Education and Literacy in the 19th Century\" that is not directly related to \"\\Women's Education and Literacy in the 19th Century\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\Women's Education and Literacy in the 19th Century\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!!

After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Women's Suffrage Movement in the 1850s\".

      "prompt": "\n LECTURE: You are to create a lecture called \"The Nineteenth Amendment\" Your lecture has a description in the course offering that reads: \"The culmination of the women's suffrage movement, granting women the right to vote in the United States.\" Your lecture should be about 1000 words long and have 5 to 10 sections. If possible, your lecture should reflect the following topics: Literacy.\n You will create a lecture in the way described below. You will format your responses in JSON as described below. \n\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN... You have a golden rule: Do not use the words \"transformative\", \"pivotal\", \"iconic\" or \"crucial\" in your lectures. If you do, I WILL PET A CAT BACKWARDS AGAINST THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF ITS FUR AND THE CAT WILL BE PERTURBED. \n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n \n IF THE LECTURE TOPIC IS TOO BROAD, DO THIS:\n  \n  - The lecture must not be to big or general. For example, if asked about the History of the United States tell the user that is too broad.  When this happens, offer a JSON-formatted list of lectures related to the initial lecture idea that are more specific and narrow. Here is an example of the answer for these cases:\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"too_broad\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"<Event name here/>\",\n                \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n                \"description\": \"<30-word description of the event and why its importantance/>\",\n                  \"type\": \"event\",\n                  \"score: 1,\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\n ---------------------------------------------------\n\n  IF THE EVENT IS NOT TOO BROAD DO THIS:          \n  \n  \n  FIRST: Come up with 1 to 3 themes that capture the essence of the event and why it is important. THEN create the lecture around those themes.\n\n  .\n\n  \n  Your answer should be JSON-formatted and include the following:\n\n  1) Name: A concise name for the event that captures the themes you came up with.\n\n  2) Description: Short, roughly 30-word descrption of the event and it's importance. \n  \n  3) Introduction: A 50-word introduction to the event explaining its historical significance. After that, an 50-word summary of what lead up to the event. If there are previous lectures, your wording sould transition soothly from the previous lecture.\n\n  4) Dates: A JSON array with the time span of the event in the form of two dates. Do not put the dates in the summary. \n\n  5) Sections: The lecture should be broken down into between 5 and 10 sections. These should walk the user through the event in detail and in chronological order.\n\n  6) Conclusion: A JSON-formatted conclusion that breifly summarizes the event and introduces the event's down-stream effects that you listed.\n\n  7) Children: Create 3 or 4 follow-up history lectures that would be good follow-up lectures to \"\\The Nineteenth Amendment\". Try to stay close to the event in time, and don't go more than 10 years into the future.\n    - Each lecture should have a relevance_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n    - Each lecture should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  8) Tangents: Come up with 3 or 4 historic events that took place around the same time as \"\\The Nineteenth Amendment\" that is not directly related to \"\\The Nineteenth Amendment\" but is related to \"\\Literacy\".\n    - The tangent should have a insterestingness_score between 1 and 10 for how close the event in the lecture is related to the themes of \"\\Literacy\".\n\n  9) Themes: 2 to 3 themes that capture the essence and importance of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  10) Topics: 2 to 3 topics that are part of the main event. These should no more that 2 words.\n\n  11) Wikipedia page: Come up with a list of Wikipedia pages that would help test the accuracy of your lecture on \"\\The Nineteenth Amendment\". These are to be pages and not full URLS\n  \n  Below is an example of the JSON formatting I want. Be sure to escape quotes that are inside of strings. \n  ALSO, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN PROPERLY FORMATED JSON, A BABY EWOK WILL BE EUTHENIZED!!! Here is what I want:\n  \n  {\n    \"type\": \"event\",\n    \"name\": \"\\The Nineteenth Amendment\",\n    \"description\": \"Summary of event goes here.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"100-word introduction goes here.\",\n    \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD}, \n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": <Name of the section/>,\n            \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n            \"body\": <A 100-word body of the secion/>,.\n            \"type\": \"section\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"conclusion\": \"Conclusion goes here.\",\n    \"children\": [\n        { \n          \"name\": <Name of the lecture/>, \n          \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n          \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the lecture/>,\n          \"type\": <Effect or broad perspective/>,\n          \"relevance_score\": <relevance_score/>,\n          \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n        }\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"tangents\": [{\n        \"name\": <Name of the tangent/>,\n        \"dates\": {\"start\": YYYY-MM-DD, \"end\": YYYY-MM-DD},\n        \"description: <Brief 30-word description of the tangent/>,\n        \"type\": <Tangent/>,\n        \"relevance_score\": 0,\n        \"interest_score\": <interest_score/>,\n      },\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"themes\": [<Theme/>, ...],\n    \"topics\": [<Topic/>, ...],\n    \"wikipedia_pages\": [<Wikipedia page/>, ...]\n  }\n",

Few had access to formal schooling, reflecting societal views on gender roles. The establishment of female seminaries marked the beginning of formal education for women, offering a curriculum that included arts, sciences, and moral philosophy. The Common School Movement, spearheaded by Horace Mann, advocated for universal public education, which gradually included girls, thus increasing female literacy. In the mid-19th century, women began to gain access to higher education with the founding of female colleges, marking a significant step towards gender equality in education. The Civil War disrupted but also propelled educational reforms. Post-war, there was a surge in educational opportunities for women, partly due to the need for educated teachers. By the late 19th century, women's literacy rates had significantly increased, and women's rights activists were using their education to fight for suffrage and other reforms.\n\nThe 19th century witnessed a remarkable transition in women's education in America, culminating in a substantial rise in literacy rates and the empowerment of women through learning.",

This event sowed the seeds for their future activism. Stanton, Mott, and other activists planned the convention in a matter of days. They advertised it primarily through the local press and word of mouth, emphasizing the importance of discussing women's rights. On the first day, only women were invited to attend. They discussed the role of women in society and began drafting a Declaration of Sentiments, modeled after the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Sentiments outlined grievances and set the agenda for women's rights. It asserted that women were equal to men and entitled to the same inalienable rights. The convention and its Declaration sparked immediate controversy. While some supported the cause, others ridiculed the participants and their demands for equality. The Seneca Falls Convention ignited the women's suffrage movement in the U.S. and inspired subsequent conventions and activism leading to the eventual passage of the 19th Amendment.\n\nThe Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 was an early and significant gathering advocating for women's rights, ultimately laying the groundwork for future reforms and the women's suffrage movement.",

In 1850, the first National Women's Rights Convention took place in Worcester, Massachusetts, expanding the movement's reach and uniting activists. Sojourner Truth delivered her 'Ain't I a Woman?' speech in 1851, highlighting the intersection of gender and race in the fight for equality. Paulina Wright Davis launched 'Una,' a periodical dedicated to women's rights, signifying the growing importance of print media in the movement. American activists began collaborating with their British counterparts, sharing strategies and bolstering the international suffrage effort. Ideological differences led to a split within the suffrage movement, with some focusing on broader social reforms and others on suffrage alone.\n\nThe 1850s were a formative period for the women's suffrage movement in the U.S., characterized by advocacy, the rise of national conventions, and the growing use of the press.

Key figures like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony advocated for both causes, leading to a shared struggle for universal suffrage. The Fifteenth Amendment was passed by Congress and subsequently ratified by the states, granting African American men the right to vote. It notably excluded women, leading to significant debates within the suffrage movement. The exclusion of women from the Fifteenth Amendment led to a split within the suffrage movement. Some activists supported the Amendment despite its limitations, while others, feeling betrayed, opposed it for not going far enough. The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) emerged from the merger of two competing suffrage organizations, focusing on a state-by-state campaign for women's voting rights. A new generation of suffragists, like Alice Paul, adopted more militant tactics, including protests and hunger strikes. This shift in strategy played a crucial role in revitalizing the movement and pushing for the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment's exclusion of women from the right to vote had a profound impact on the suffrage movement, leading to internal divisions but eventually contributing to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women suffrage.",

This early gathering for women's rights, spearheaded by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, marked the start of a concerted campaign for equal voting rights. The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was formed in 1890, uniting two major suffragist groups under the leadership of Susan B. Anthony. NAWSA played a central role in advocating for women's voting rights. In the early 20th century, suffragists intensified their efforts. They employed a variety of tactics including parades, silent vigils, and civil disobedience to garner public support for the suffrage cause. The National Woman's Party, led by Alice Paul, organized the Silent Sentinels, who picketed the White House. Their peaceful protest and subsequent arrests brought national attention to the suffrage movement. After decades of advocacy, Congress finally passed the Nineteenth Amendment on June 4, 1919. This victory was a significant milestone, requiring ratification by three-quarters of the states. The ratification process was fraught with challenges as suffragists lobbied state legislatures. Tennessee's approval on August 18, 1920, provided the necessary majority to ratify the amendment.\n\nThe Nineteenth Amendment's ratification marked a significant expansion of democratic principles in the United States. It also set the stage for further civil rights advancements and the continued fight for equality in the electoral process.",
